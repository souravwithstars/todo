## To-do
---
A simple **To-do** list built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript helps multiple users maintain their To-dos.

### A User can -

  * ***CREATE*** one or more To-do lists. Each list should contain at least a **title**.

  * ***VIEW*** all To-do lists.

  * ***ADD*** a To-do item to a To-do list. A To-do list can consist of **zero** or more To-do items.

  * ***MARK*** a To-do item as being **done** or **undone**. By default, a To-do item is **undone** until it is marked **done**.

  * ***DELETE*** a To-do item or a To-do list also.
